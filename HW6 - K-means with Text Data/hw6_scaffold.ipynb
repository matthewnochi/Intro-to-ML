This naturally trades off between trying to minimize heterogeneity, but reduce number of clusters.  In the heterogeneity versus K plot made above, we did not yet really see a flattening out of the heterogeneity, which might indicate that indeed K=100 is \"reasonable\" and we only diminishing returns for larger values of K (which are even harder to visualize using the methods we attempted above.)"
